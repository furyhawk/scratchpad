This file is to help you use this routine.
Since our ink screens are getting more and more, it is not convenient for our maintenance, so all the ink screen programs are made into one project.
A brief description of the use of this project is here:

1. Basic information:
This example is used to test or demonstrate the WS2812B on the RP2350-LCD-1.47 series development board;

2. Pin connection:
RGB_IO    ->    22

3. Basic use:
You need to execute:
    If the directory already exists, you can go directly. If there is no build directory, execute
         mkdir build
     Enter the build directory and type in the terminal:
         cd build
         export PICO_SDK_PATH=../../pico-sdk
     Where ../../pico-sdk is your installed SDK directory
     Execute cmake, automatically generate Makefile file, enter in the terminal:
         cmake ..
