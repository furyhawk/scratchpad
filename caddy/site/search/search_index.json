This is to prevent the model from learning obvious predictor. sudo ./scripts/run_pipeline.sh -nrci Web Scraping With Python Objective This tutorial aims to show how to use the Python programming language to web scrape a website. Specifically, we will use the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape and parse data from companiesmarketcap.com and retrieve the \u201c Largest Companies by Market Cap \u201d. Finance details are scrape and parse from finance.yahoo.com . We will learn how to scale the web scraping process by first retrieving the first company/row of the table, then all companies on the website\u2019s first page, and finally, all 6024 companies from multiple pages. Once the scraping process is complete, we will preprocess the dataset and transform it into a more readable format before using matplotlib to visualise the most important information.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-124c41","text":"type: short summary \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2af8 Summary in present tense.

Otherwise they will keep updating their internal mean and variance, which can interfere with the very small updates applied to the surrounding Conv2D layers. Steps per Epoch Based on what you said it sounds like you need a larger batch_size, and of course there are implications with that which could impact the steps_per_epoch and number of epochs. To solve for jumping-around - A **larger batch size** will give you a better gradient and will help to prevent jumping around - You may also want to consider a smaller learning rate, or a learning rate scheduler (or decay) to allow the network to \"settle in\" as it trains Feature Extraction All of the models in timm have consistent mechanisms for obtaining various types of features from the model for tasks besides classification. Penultimate Layer Features (Pre-Classifier Features) The features from the penultimate model layer can be obtained in several ways without requiring model surgery (although feel free to do surgery). One must first decide if they want pooled or un-pooled features. Unpooled There are three ways to obtain unpooled features. Without modifying the network, one can call model.forward_features(input) on any model instead of the usual model(input) . This will bypass the head classifier and global pooling for networks. If one wants to explicitly modify the network to return unpooled features, they can either create the model without a classifier and pooling, or remove it later. Both paths remove the parameters associated with the classifier from the network. forward_features() import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('xception41', pretrained=True) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 299, 299)) print(f'Original shape: {o.shape}') o = m.forward_features(torch.randn(2, 3, 299, 299)) print(f'Unpooled shape: {o.shape}') Output: Original shape: torch.Size([2, 1000]) Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048, 10, 10]) Create with no classifier and pooling import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('resnet50', pretrained=True, num_classes=0, global_pool='') o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Unpooled shape: {o.shape}') Output: Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048, 7, 7]) Remove it later import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('densenet121', pretrained=True) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Original shape: {o.shape}') m.reset_classifier(0, '') o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Unpooled shape: {o.shape}') Output: Original shape: torch.Size([2, 1000]) Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 1024, 7, 7]) Pooled To modify the network to return pooled features, one can use forward_features() and pool/flatten the result themselves, or modify the network like above but keep pooling intact. Create with no classifier import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('resnet50', pretrained=True, num_classes=0) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Pooled shape: {o.shape}') Output: Pooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048]) Remove it later import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('ese_vovnet19b_dw', pretrained=True) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Original shape: {o.shape}') m.reset_classifier(0) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) print(f'Pooled shape: {o.shape}') Output: Original shape: torch.Size([2, 1000]) Pooled shape: torch.Size([2, 1024]) Multi-scale Feature Maps (Feature Pyramid) Object detection, segmentation, keypoint, and a variety of dense pixel tasks require access to feature maps from the backbone network at multiple scales. This is often done by modifying the original classification network. Since each network varies quite a bit in structure, it's not uncommon to see only a few backbones supported in any given obj detection or segmentation library. timm allows a consistent interface for creating any of the included models as feature backbones that output feature maps for selected levels. A feature backbone can be created by adding the argument features_only=True to any create_model call. By default 5 strides will be output from most models (not all have that many), with the first starting at 2 (some start at 1 or 4). Create a feature map extraction model import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('resnest26d', features_only=True, pretrained=True) o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) for x in o: print(x.shape) Output: torch.Size([2, 64, 112, 112]) torch.Size([2, 256, 56, 56]) torch.Size([2, 512, 28, 28]) torch.Size([2, 1024, 14, 14]) torch.Size([2, 2048, 7, 7]) Query the feature information After a feature backbone has been created, it can be queried to provide channel or resolution reduction information to the downstream heads without requiring static config or hardcoded constants. The .feature_info attribute is a class encapsulating the information about the feature extraction points. import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('regnety_032', features_only=True, pretrained=True) print(f'Feature channels: {m.feature_info.channels()}') o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)) for x in o: print(x.shape) Output: Feature channels: [32, 72, 216, 576, 1512] torch.Size([2, 32, 112, 112]) torch.Size([2, 72, 56, 56]) torch.Size([2, 216, 28, 28]) torch.Size([2, 576, 14, 14]) torch.Size([2, 1512, 7, 7]) Select specific feature levels or limit the stride There are two additional creation arguments impacting the output features. out_indices selects which indices to output output_stride limits the feature output stride of the network (also works in classification mode BTW) out_indices is supported by all models, but not all models have the same index to feature stride mapping. Look at the code or check feature_info to compare. The out indices generally correspond to the C(i+1)th feature level (a 2^(i+1) reduction). For most models, index 0 is the stride 2 features, and index 4 is stride 32. output_stride is achieved by converting layers to use dilated convolutions. Doing so is not always straightforward, some networks only support output_stride=32 . import torch import timm m = timm.create_model('ecaresnet101d', features_only=True, output_stride=8, out_indices=(2, 4), pretrained=True) print(f'Feature channels: {m.feature_info.channels()}') print(f'Feature reduction: {m.feature_info.reduction()}') o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 320, 320)) for x in o: print(x.shape) Output: Feature channels: [512, 2048] Feature reduction: [8, 8] torch.Size([2, 512, 40, 40]) torch.Size([2, 2048, 40, 40]) GloabalPooling Reduce computation by 75%. Summarise features. GlobalMaxPooling Feature extraction after covn layer. Use of GlobalAvgPooling One advantage of global average pooling over the fully connected layers is that it is more native to the convolution structure by enforcing correspondences between feature maps and categories. Thus the feature maps can be easily interpreted as categories confidence maps. Another advantage is that there is no parameter to optimize in the global average pooling thus overfitting is avoided at this layer. Futhermore, global average pooling sums out the spatial information, thus it is more robust to spatial translations of the input. We can see global average pooling as a structural regularizer that explicitly enforces feature maps to be confidence maps of concepts (categories). This is made possible by the mlpconv layers, as they makes better approximation to the confidence maps than GLMs. How filter init Note that we use the same weight initialization formula as with the MLP. Weights are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution in the range [-1/fan-in, 1/fan-in], where fan-in is the number of inputs to a hidden unit. For MLPs, this was the number of units in the layer below. For CNNs however, we have to take into account the number of input feature maps and the size of the receptive fields. Transfer Learning In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. The three major Transfer Learning scenarios look as follows: ConvNet as fixed feature extractor. Take a ConvNet pretrained on ImageNet, remove the last fully-connected layer (this layer's outputs are the 1000 class scores for a different task like ImageNet), then treat the rest of the ConvNet as a fixed feature extractor for the new dataset. In an AlexNet, this would compute a 4096-D vector for every image that contains the activations of the hidden layer immediately before the classifier. We call these features CNN codes. It is important for performance that these codes are ReLUd (i.e. thresholded at zero) if they were also thresholded during the training of the ConvNet on ImageNet (as is usually the case). Once you extract the 4096-D codes for all images, train a linear classifier (e.g. Linear SVM or Softmax classifier) for the new dataset. Fine-tuning the ConvNet. The second strategy is to not only replace and retrain the classifier on top of the ConvNet on the new dataset, but to also fine-tune the weights of the pretrained network by continuing the backpropagation. It is possible to fine-tune all the layers of the ConvNet, or it's possible to keep some of the earlier layers fixed (due to overfitting concerns) and only fine-tune some higher-level portion of the network. This is motivated by the observation that the earlier features of a ConvNet contain more generic features (e.g. edge detectors or color blob detectors) that should be useful to many tasks, but later layers of the ConvNet becomes progressively more specific to the details of the classes contained in the original dataset. In case of ImageNet for example, which contains many dog breeds, a significant portion of the representational power of the ConvNet may be devoted to features that are specific to differentiating between dog breeds. When and how to fine-tune? How do you decide what type of transfer learning you should perform on a new dataset? This is a function of several factors, but the two most important ones are the size of the new dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the original dataset (e.g. ImageNet-like in terms of the content of images and the classes, or very different, such as microscope images). Keeping in mind that ConvNet features are more generic in early layers and more original-dataset-specific in later layers, here are some common rules of thumb for navigating the 4 major scenarios: New dataset is small and similar to original dataset. Since the data is small, it is not a good idea to fine-tune the ConvNet due to overfitting concerns. Since the data is similar to the original data, we expect higher-level features in the ConvNet to be relevant to this dataset as well. Hence, the best idea might be to train a linear classifier on the CNN codes. New dataset is large and similar to the original dataset. Since we have more data, we can have more confidence that we won't overfit if we were to try to fine-tune through the full network. New dataset is small but very different from the original dataset. Since the data is small, it is likely best to only train a linear classifier. Since the dataset is very different, it might not be best to train the classifier form the top of the network, which contains more dataset-specific features. Instead, it might work better to train the SVM classifier from activations somewhere earlier in the network. New dataset is large and very different from the original dataset. Since the dataset is very large, we may expect that we can afford to train a ConvNet from scratch. However, in practice it is very often still beneficial to initialize with weights from a pretrained model. In this case, we would have enough data and confidence to fine-tune through the entire network. Practical advice. There are a few additional things to keep in mind when performing Transfer Learning: Constraints from pretrained models . Note that if you wish to use a pretrained network, you may be slightly constrained in terms of the architecture you can use for your new dataset. For example, you can't arbitrarily take out Conv layers from the pretrained network. However, some changes are straight-forward: Due to parameter sharing, you can easily run a pretrained network on images of different spatial size. This is clearly evident in the case of Conv/Pool layers because their forward function is independent of the input volume spatial size (as long as the strides \"fit\"). In case of FC layers, this still holds true because FC layers can be converted to a Convolutional Layer: For example, in an AlexNet, the final pooling volume before the first FC layer is of size [6x6x512]. Therefore, the FC layer looking at this volume is equivalent to having a Convolutional Layer that has receptive field size 6x6, and is applied with padding of 0. Learning rates . It's common to use a smaller learning rate for ConvNet weights that are being fine-tuned, in comparison to the (randomly-initialized) weights for the new linear classifier that computes the class scores of your new dataset. This is because we expect that the ConvNet weights are relatively good, so we don't wish to distort them too quickly and too much (especially while the new Linear Classifier above them is being trained from random initialization). Implications of a larger batch-size - Too large of a batch_size can produce memory problems, especially if you are using a GPU. Once you exceed the limit, dial it back until it works. This will help you find the max batch-size that your system can work with. - Too large of a batch size can get you stuck in a local minima, so if your training get stuck, I would reduce it some. Imagine here you are over-correcting the jumping-around and it's not jumping around enough to further minimize the loss function. When to reduce epochs - If your train error is very low, yet your test/validation is very high, then you have over-fit the model with too many epochs. - The best way to find the right balance is to use early-stopping with a validation test set. Here you can specify when to stop training, and save the weights for the network that gives you the best validation loss. (I highly recommend using this always) When to adjust steps-per-epoch - Traditionally, the steps per epoch is calculated as train_length // batch_size, since this will use all of the data points, one batch size worth at a time. - If you are augmenting the data, then you can stretch this a tad (sometimes I multiply that function above by 2 or 3 etc. But, if it's already training for too long, then I would just stick with the traditional approach. When to Scale Rule of thumb I follow here is any algorithm that computes distance or assumes normality, scale your features!!! Some examples of algorithms where feature scaling matters are: - k-nearest neighbors with an Euclidean distance measure is sensitive to magnitudes and hence should be scaled for all features to weigh in equally. - Scaling is critical, while performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance and the variance is high for high magnitude features. This skews the PCA towards high magnitude features. - We can speed up gradient descent by scaling. This is because \u03b8 will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven. - Tree based models are not distance based models and can handle varying ranges of features. Hence, Scaling is not required while modelling trees. Algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), Naive Bayes are by design equipped to handle this and gives weights to the features accordingly. Performing a features scaling in these algorithms may not have much effect.

Once you extract the 4096-D codes for all images, train a linear classifier (e.g. Linear SVM or Softmax classifier) for the new dataset. Fine-tuning the ConvNet. The second strategy is to not only replace and retrain the classifier on top of the ConvNet on the new dataset, but to also fine-tune the weights of the pretrained network by continuing the backpropagation. It is possible to fine-tune all the layers of the ConvNet, or it's possible to keep some of the earlier layers fixed (due to overfitting concerns) and only fine-tune some higher-level portion of the network. This is motivated by the observation that the earlier features of a ConvNet contain more generic features (e.g. edge detectors or color blob detectors) that should be useful to many tasks, but later layers of the ConvNet becomes progressively more specific to the details of the classes contained in the original dataset. In case of ImageNet for example, which contains many dog breeds, a significant portion of the representational power of the ConvNet may be devoted to features that are specific to differentiating between dog breeds.","title":"Transfer Learning"},{"location":"machine_learning/#when-and-how-to-fine-tune","text":"How do you decide what type of transfer learning you should perform on a new dataset? This is a function of several factors, but the two most important ones are the size of the new dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the original dataset (e.g. ImageNet-like in terms of the content of images and the classes, or very different, such as microscope images). Keeping in mind that ConvNet features are more generic in early layers and more original-dataset-specific in later layers, here are some common rules of thumb for navigating the 4 major scenarios: New dataset is small and similar to original dataset. Since the data is small, it is not a good idea to fine-tune the ConvNet due to overfitting concerns. Since the data is similar to the original data, we expect higher-level features in the ConvNet to be relevant to this dataset as well. Hence, the best idea might be to train a linear classifier on the CNN codes. New dataset is large and similar to the original dataset. Since we have more data, we can have more confidence that we won't overfit if we were to try to fine-tune through the full network. New dataset is small but very different from the original dataset. Since the data is small, it is likely best to only train a linear classifier. Since the dataset is very different, it might not be best to train the classifier form the top of the network, which contains more dataset-specific features. Instead, it might work better to train the SVM classifier from activations somewhere earlier in the network. New dataset is large and very different from the original dataset. Since the dataset is very large, we may expect that we can afford to train a ConvNet from scratch. However, in practice it is very often still beneficial to initialize with weights from a pretrained model. In this case, we would have enough data and confidence to fine-tune through the entire network.","title":"When and how to fine-tune?"},{"location":"machine_learning/#practical-advice","text":"There are a few additional things to keep in mind when performing Transfer Learning: Constraints from pretrained models . Note that if you wish to use a pretrained network, you may be slightly constrained in terms of the architecture you can use for your new dataset. For example, you can't arbitrarily take out Conv layers from the pretrained network. However, some changes are straight-forward: Due to parameter sharing, you can easily run a pretrained network on images of different spatial size. This is clearly evident in the case of Conv/Pool layers because their forward function is independent of the input volume spatial size (as long as the strides \"fit\"). In case of FC layers, this still holds true because FC layers can be converted to a Convolutional Layer: For example, in an AlexNet, the final pooling volume before the first FC layer is of size [6x6x512]. Therefore, the FC layer looking at this volume is equivalent to having a Convolutional Layer that has receptive field size 6x6, and is applied with padding of 0. Learning rates . It's common to use a smaller learning rate for ConvNet weights that are being fine-tuned, in comparison to the (randomly-initialized) weights for the new linear classifier that computes the class scores of your new dataset. This is because we expect that the ConvNet weights are relatively good, so we don't wish to distort them too quickly and too much (especially while the new Linear Classifier above them is being trained from random initialization). Implications of a larger batch-size - Too large of a batch_size can produce memory problems, especially if you are using a GPU. Once you exceed the limit, dial it back until it works. This will help you find the max batch-size that your system can work with. - Too large of a batch size can get you stuck in a local minima, so if your training get stuck, I would reduce it some. Imagine here you are over-correcting the jumping-around and it's not jumping around enough to further minimize the loss function. When to reduce epochs - If your train error is very low, yet your test/validation is very high, then you have over-fit the model with too many epochs. - The best way to find the right balance is to use early-stopping with a validation test set. Here you can specify when to stop training, and save the weights for the network that gives you the best validation loss. (I highly recommend using this always) When to adjust steps-per-epoch - Traditionally, the steps per epoch is calculated as train_length // batch_size, since this will use all of the data points, one batch size worth at a time. - If you are augmenting the data, then you can stretch this a tad (sometimes I multiply that function above by 2 or 3 etc. But, if it's already training for too long, then I would just stick with the traditional approach.","title":"Practical advice."},{"location":"machine_learning/#when-to-scale","text":"Rule of thumb I follow here is any algorithm that computes distance or assumes normality, scale your features!!! Some examples of algorithms where feature scaling matters are: - k-nearest neighbors with an Euclidean distance measure is sensitive to magnitudes and hence should be scaled for all features to weigh in equally. - Scaling is critical, while performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance and the variance is high for high magnitude features. This skews the PCA towards high magnitude features. - We can speed up gradient descent by scaling. This is because \u03b8 will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven. - Tree based models are not distance based models and can handle varying ranges of features. Hence, Scaling is not required while modelling trees. Algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), Naive Bayes are by design equipped to handle this and gives weights to the features accordingly. Performing a features scaling in these algorithms may not have much effect.","title":"When to Scale"},{"location":"machine_learning/#pytorch-loss-function-cheatsheet","text":"PyTorch Loss-Input Confusion (Cheatsheet) torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy takes logistic sigmoid values as inputs torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits takes logits as inputs torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy takes logits as inputs (performs log_softmax internally) torch.nn.functional.nll_loss is like cross_entropy but takes log-probabilities (log-softmax) values as inputs","title":"PyTorch Loss Function Cheatsheet"},{"location":"macos/","text":"macos find . -name ._\\* -delete","title":"macos"},{"location":"macos/#macos","text":"find . -name ._\\* -delete","title":"macos"},{"location":"mkdocs/","text":"Welcome to MkDocs For full documentation visit mkdocs.org .

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others. To share files through Samba, see #Server section; to access files shared through Samba on other machines, please see #Client section. Server cd /mnt/ sudo mkdir media nano /home/user/.credentials sudo chmod 400 /home/user/.credentials sudo mount -t cifs -o rw,vers=3.0,credentials=/home/user/.credentials //coco.local/media/ /mnt/media sudo nano /etc/fstab # smbclient -L hostname -U% # //coco.local/media /mnt/media cifs vers=3.0,credentials=/home/user/.credentials Installation Install the package. Samba is configured in the configuration file, which is extensively documented in . Because the package does not provide this file, one needs to create it before starting . A documented example as in from the Samba git repository may be used to setup . Enabling and starting services To provide basic file sharing through SMB, enable/start . See for details. If you want to make your server accessible via NetBIOS host name, set the desired name in the option in and enable/start . See for details. Make the server discoverable Install the package, then enable/start to make the samba server discoverable with Zeroconf . It should work for most non-Windows file managers (macOS Finder, various GUI-based file managers on Linux & BSD etc.) If is not running, the server will still be accessible, just not discoverable, i.e. it will not show up in file managers, but you can still connect to the server directly by IP or domain. Windows Explorer relies on the WS-Discovery protocol instead; see #Windows 1709 or up does not discover the samba server in Network view . Configure firewall If you are using a firewall , do not forget to open required ports (usually 137-139 + 445). For a complete list, see Samba port usage . UFW Rule A Ufw App Profile for SMB/CIFS is included by default with the default installation of UFW in . Allow Samba by running as root. If you deleted the profile, create/edit and add the following content: [Samba] title=LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix description=The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol. ports=137,138/udp|139,445/tcp Then load the profile into UFW run as root. Then finally, allow Samba by running as root. firewalld service To configure firewalld to allow Samba in the home zone, run: # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service={samba,samba-client,samba-dc} --zone=home The three services listed are: : for sharing files with others. : to browse shares on other machines on the network. : for Samba/Active Directory domain controller . ensures the changes remain after is restarted . Basic configuration User management The following section describes creating a local (tdbsam) database of Samba users. For user authentication and other purposes, Samba can also be bound to an Active Directory domain, can itself serve as an Active Directory domain controller, or can be used with an LDAP server. Adding a user Samba requires a Linux user account - you may use an existing user account or create a new one . Although the user name is shared with Linux system, Samba uses a password separate from that of the Linux user accounts. Replace with the chosen Samba user account: # smbpasswd -a samba_user Depending on the server role , existing File permissions and attributes may need to be altered for the Samba user account. If you want the new user only to be allowed to remotely access the file server shares through Samba, you can restrict other login options\uff1a disabling shell - disabling SSH logons - edit , change option Also see Security for hardening your system. Listing users Samba users can be listed using the command: # pdbedit -L -v Changing user password To change a user password, use : # smbpasswd samba_user Creating an anonymous share 1. Create a Linux user which anonymous Samba users will be mapped to. # useradd guest -s /bin/nologin 2. Add the following to : Anonymous users will now be mapped to the Linux user and have the ability to access any directories defined in , which is configured to be in the example above. Make sure that the Linux user has the proper permissions to access files in . Also, make sure shares have been properly defined as per the Share Definitions section of smb.conf.default . Advanced configuration Enable symlink following Then, restart . Enable server-side copy for macOS clients Server-side copy eliminates the need to transfer data between the server and the client when copying files on the server. This is enabled by default, but it doesn't work with macOS clients. If you have macOS clients, you need to add the following configuration to and then restart . Enable Usershares Usershares is a feature that gives non-root users the capability to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions. See . Create a directory for usershares: Create a user group : Change the owner of the directory to and the group to : Change the permissions of the directory so that users in the group can create files. This command also sets sticky bit , which is important to prevent users from deleting usershares of other users: Set the following parameters in the configuration file: Add the user to the sambashare group. Replace with the name of your user: # gpasswd sambashare -a your_username Restart and services. Log out and log back in. If you want to share paths inside your home directory you must make it accessible for the group others . In the GUI, you can use Thunar or Dolphin - right click on any directory and share it on the network. In the CLI, use one of the following commands, replacing italic sharename , user , ... : # net usershare add sharename abspath [ comment ] [ user :{R|D|F}] [guest_ok={y|n}] # net usershare delete sharename # net usershare list wildcard-sharename # net usershare info wildcard-sharename Set and forcing permissions Permissions may be applied to both the server and shares: See for a full overview of possible permission flags and settings. Restrict protocols for better security Append and in to force usage of a minimum and maximum protocol: See in for an overview of supported protocols. For compatibility with older clients and/or servers, you might need to set or , but please note that this makes you vulnerable to exploits in SMB1 including ransomware attacks. Clients using may need to specify the correct , e.g.: # mount -t cifs // SERVER / sharename /mnt/ mountpoint -o username= username ,password= password ,iocharset= utf8 ,vers= 3.1.1 See for more information. Use native SMB transport encryption Native SMB transport encryption is available in SMB version 3.0 or newer. Clients supporting this type of encryption include Windows 8 and newer, Windows server 2012 and newer, and smbclient of Samba 4.1 and newer. To use native SMB transport encryption by default, set the parameter globally and/or by share. Possible values are , (default value), , or : To configure encryption for on the client side, use the option . See for more information, especially the paragraphs Effects for SMB1 and Effects for SMB2 . Disable printer sharing By default Samba shares printers configured using CUPS . If you do not want printers to be shared, use the following settings: Block certain file extensions on Samba share Samba offers an option to block files with certain patterns, like file extensions. This option can be used to prevent dissemination of viruses or to dissuade users from wasting space with certain files. More information about this option can be found in . Improve throughput The default settings should be sufficient for most users. However setting the 'socket options' correct can improve performance, but getting them wrong can degrade it by just as much. Test the effect before making any large changes. Read the man page before applying any of the options listed below. The following settings should be appended to the section of . Setting a deadtime is useful to stop a server's resources from being exhausted by a large number of inactive connections: deadtime = 30 The usage of sendfile may make more efficient use of the system CPU's and cause Samba to be faster: use sendfile = yes Setting min receivefile size allows zero-copy writes directly from network socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache (if available). It may improve performance but user testing is recommended: min receivefile size = 16384 Increasing the receive/send buffers size and socket optimize flags might be useful to improve throughput. It is recommended to test each flag separately as it may cause issues on some networks: socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_THROUGHPUT SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072 Enable access for old clients/devices Latest versions of Samba no longer offer older authentication methods and protocols which are still used by some older clients (IP cameras, etc). These devices usually require Samba server to allow NTMLv1 authentication and NT1 version of the protocol, known as CIFS. For these devices to work with latest Samba, you need to add these two configuration parameters into section: server min protocol = NT1 ntlm auth = yes Anonymous/guest access to a share requires just the first parameter. If the old device will access with username and password, you also need the add the second line too. Enable Spotlight searching Spotlight allows supporting clients (e.g. MacOS Finder) to quickly search shared files. Install and start/enable OpenSearch . Install , configure the directories you want to index in , and start/enable for periodic indexing. Edit as described in the Samba wiki to enable Spotlight per share, and restart to apply the changes. Client Install for an -like command line interface. See for commonly used commands. For a lightweight alternative (without support for listing public shares, etc.), install that provides . Depending on the desktop environment , GUI methods may be available. See #File manager configuration for use with a file manager. List public shares The following command lists public shares on a server: $ smbclient -L hostname -U% Alternatively, running will show a tree diagram of all the shares. It uses broadcast queries and is therefore not advisable on a network with a lot of computers, but can be helpful for diagnosing if you have the correct sharename. The () option suppresses the password prompt. NetBIOS/WINS host names Samba clients handle NetBIOS host names automatically by default (the behavior is controlled by the option in ). Other programs (including ) typically use Name Service Switch , which does not handle NetBIOS by default. The package provides a libnss driver to resolve NetBIOS host names. To use it, install it along with the package (which provides the winbindd daemon), start/enable and add to the line in : Now, during host resolving (e.g. when using or just ), winbindd will resolve the host name by sending queries using NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS, also known as WINS) protocol. By default it sends a broadcast query to your local network. If you have a WINS server, you can add to and restart , then winbindd and other Samba clients will send unicast queries to the specified IP. If you want to resolve your local host name (specified in the option in ), start/enable , which will handle incoming queries. You can test WINS resolution with . By default it sends broadcast queries to your local network regardless of the option. Note that WINS resolution requires incoming traffic originating from port 137. Disable NetBIOS/WINS support When not using NetBIOS/WINS host name resolution, it may be preferred to disable this protocol: /etc/samba/smb.conf [global] disable netbios = yes dns proxy = no Finally disable / stop . Manual mounting Mount the share using as . Not all the options listed below are needed or desirable: # mount --mkdir -t cifs // SERVER / sharename /mnt/ mountpoint -o username= username ,password= password ,workgroup= workgroup ,iocharset= utf8 ,uid= username ,gid= group The options uid and gid corresponds to the local (e.g. client) user / user group to have read/write access on the given path. Note : If the uid and gid being used does not match the user of the server, the forceuid and forcegid options may be helpful. However note permissions assigned to a file when forceuid or forcegid are in effect may not reflect the the real (server) permissions. See the File And Directory Ownership And Permissions section in mount.cifs(8) \u00a7\u202fFILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS for more information. To mount a Windows share without authentication, use \"username=*\". Warning : Using uid and/or gid as mount options may cause I/O errors, it is recommended to set/check correct File permissions and attributes instead. SERVER \u2014 The server name. sharename \u2014 The shared directory. mountpoint \u2014 The local directory where the share will be mounted. [-o options] \u2014 See for more information. Note : Abstain from using a trailing /. //SERVER/sharename/ will not work. If your mount does not work stable, stutters or freezes, try to enable different SMB protocol version with vers= option. For example, vers=2.0 for Windows Vista mount. If having timeouts on a mounted network share with cifs on a shutdown, see wpa_supplicant#Problem with mounted network shares (cifs) and shutdown. Storing share passwords Storing passwords in a world readable file is not recommended. A safer method is to use a credentials file instead, e.g. inside /etc/samba/credentials : /etc/samba/credentials/share username=myuser password=mypass For the mount command replace username=myuser,password=mypass with credentials=/etc/samba/credentials/share . The credential file should explicitly readable/writeable to root: # chown root:root /etc/samba/credentials # chmod 700 /etc/samba/credentials # chmod 600 /etc/samba/credentials/share Automatic mounting Note : You may need to enable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service or NetworkManager-wait-online.service (depending on your setup) to proper enable booting on start-up. Using NetworkManager and GIO/gvfs NetworkManager can be configured to run a script on network status change. This script uses the gio command so that it mounts the Samba shares automatically, the same way your file manager does, as explained below . The script also safely unmounts the Samba shares before the relevant network connection is disabled by listening for the and events.

If everything works as expected, install . Then, add the following line to : user_allow_other Now copy the directory to your home directory: $ cp -a /etc/smbnetfs/.smb ~ Then create a link to : $ ln -sf /etc/samba/smb.conf ~/.smb/smb.conf If a username and a password are required to access some of the shared folders, edit to include one or more entries like this: It is also possible to add entries for specific hosts to be mounted by smbnetfs, if necessary. More details can be found in . If you are using the Dolphin or GNOME Files , you may want to add the following to to avoid \"Disk full\" errors as smbnetfs by default will report 0 bytes of free space: When you are done with the configuration, you need to run $ chmod 600 ~/.smb/smbnetfs.* Otherwise, smbnetfs complains about 'insecure config file permissions'. Finally, to mount your Samba network neighbourhood to a directory of your choice, call $ smbnetfs mount_point Daemon The Arch Linux package also maintains an additional system-wide operation mode for smbnetfs. To enable it, you need to make the said modifications in the directory . Then, you can start and/or enable the daemon as usual. The system-wide mount point is at . autofs See Autofs for information on the kernel-based automounter for Linux. File manager configuration GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar and PCManFM In order to access samba shares through GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar or PCManFM, install the package. Press and enter in the location bar to access your share. The mounted share is likely to be present at or in the filesystem. KDE KDE applications (like Dolphin) has the ability to browse Samba shares built in. Use the path to browse the files. If you want to access files from on non-KDE application, you can install . To use a GUI in the KDE System Settings, you will need to install the package. Other graphical environments There are a number of useful programs, but they may need to have packages created for them. This can be done with the Arch package build system. The good thing about these others is that they do not require a particular environment to be installed to support them, and so they bring along less baggage. LinNeighborhood, RUmba, xffm-samba plugin for Xffm are not available in the official repositories or the AUR. As they are not officially (or even unofficially supported), they may be obsolete and may not work at all. Tips and tricks Discovering network shares If nothing is known about other systems on the local network, and automated tools such as smbnetfs are not available, you can manually probe for Samba shares. First, install the and packages. Use nmap to scan your local network to find systems with TCP port 445 open, which is the port used by the SMB protocol. Note that you may need to use or set a custom ping scan type (e.g. ) because Windows systems are usually firewalled. The first result is another system; the second happens to be the client from where this scan was performed. Now you can connect to there IP addresses directly, but if you want to use NetBIOS host names, you can use to check for NetBIOS names. Note that this will not work if NetBIOS is disabled on the server. Regardless of the output, look for \\<20> , which shows the host with open services. Use to list which services are shared on these systems. You can use NetBIOS host name ( in this example) instead of IP when available. If prompted for a password, pressing enter should still display the list: Remote control of Windows computer Samba offers a set of tools for communication with Windows. These can be handy if access to a Windows computer through remote desktop is not an option, as shown by some examples. Send shutdown command with a comment: $ net rpc shutdown -C \"comment\" -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD A forced shutdown instead can be invoked by changing -C with comment to a single -f. For a restart, only add -r, followed by a -C or -f. Stop and start services: $ net rpc service stop SERVICENAME -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD To see all possible net rpc command: $ net rpc Troubleshooting Failed to start Samba SMB/CIFS server Possible solutions: Check on syntactic errors with .

Windows 7 connectivity problems - mount error(12): cannot allocate memory A known Windows 7 bug that causes \"mount error(12): cannot allocate memory\" on an otherwise perfect cifs share on the Linux end can be fixed by setting a few registry keys on the Windows box as follows: (set to ) (set to ) Alternatively, start Command Prompt in Admin Mode and execute the following: reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\" /v \"LargeSystemCache\" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\" /v \"Size\" /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f Do one of the following for the settings to take effect: Restart Windows Restart the Server service via services.msc From the Command Prompt run: 'net stop lanmanserver' and 'net start lanmanserver' - The server may automatically restart after stopping it. Original article . Windows 10 1709 and up connectivity problems - \"Windows cannot access\" 0x80004005 This error affects some machines running Windows 10 version 1709 and later. It is not related to SMB1 being disabled in this version but to the fact that Microsoft disabled insecure logons for guests on this version for some, but not others. To fix, open Group Policy Editor (). Navigate to Computer configuration\\administrative templates\\network\\Lanman Workstation > Enable insecure guest logons and enable it. Alternatively,change the following value in the registry: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters] \"AllowInsecureGuestAuth\"=dword:1 Error: Failed to retrieve printer list: NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL If you are a home user and using samba purely for file sharing from a server or NAS, you are probably not interested in sharing printers through it. If so, you can prevent this error from occurring by adding the following lines to your : Restart the samba service, , and then check your logs: # cat /var/log/samba/smbd.log and the error should now no longer be appearing. Sharing a folder fails It means that while you are sharing a folder from Dolphin (file manager) and everything seems ok at first, after restarting Dolphin the share icon is gone from the shared folder, and also some output like this in terminal ( Konsole ) output: \u2018net usershare\u2019 returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled To fix it, enable usershare as described in #Enable Usershares . \"Browsing\" network fails with \"Failed to retrieve share list from server\" And you are using a firewall (iptables) because you do not trust your local (school, university, hotel) network. This may be due to the following: When the smbclient is browsing the local network it sends out a broadcast request on udp port 137. The servers on the network then reply to your client but as the source address of this reply is different from the destination address iptables saw when sending the request for the listing out, iptables will not recognize the reply as being \"ESTABLISHED\" or \"RELATED\", and hence the packet is dropped. A possible solution is to add: iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 137 -j CT --helper netbios-ns to your iptables setup. For Uncomplicated Firewall , you need to add to the end of the following line in IPT_MODULES=\"nf_conntrack_ftp nf_nat_ftp nf_conntrack_irc nf_nat_irc\" and then run the following commands as root: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper ufw allow CIFS ufw reload To make this change persistent across reboots, add the following line at the end of : net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper=1 Protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE The client probably does not have access to shares. Make sure clients' IP address is in line in . Another problem could be, that the client uses an invalid protocol version. To check this try to connect with the where you specify the maximum protocol version manually: $ smbclient -U -L // -m <protocol version: e. g. SMB2> -W If the command was successful then create a configuration file: Connection to SERVER failed: (Error NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL) You are probably passing a wrong server name to . To find out the server name, run on the server and look at \"Transient hostname\" line Connection to SERVER failed: (Error NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED) Make sure that the server has started.

Or just pass argument to . Password Error when correct credentials are given (error 1326) Samba 4.5 has NTLMv1 authentication disabled by default. It is recommend to install the latest available upgrades on clients and deny access for unsupported clients. If you still need support for very old clients without NTLMv2 support (e.g. Windows XP), it is possible force enable NTLMv1, although this is not recommend for security reasons: If NTLMv2 clients are unable to authenticate when NTLMv1 has been enabled, create the following file on the client: This change also affects samba shares mounted with mount.cifs . If after upgrade to Samba 4.5 your mount fails, add the sec=ntlmssp option to your mount command, e.g. mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o sec=ntlmssp,... See the man page: ntlmssp - Use NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message. The default in mainline kernel versions prior to v3.8 was sec=ntlm . In v3.8, the default was changed to sec=ntlmssp . Mapping reserved Windows characters Starting with kernel 3.18, the cifs module uses the \"mapposix\" option by default . When mounting a share using unix extensions and a default Samba configuration, files and directories containing one of the seven reserved Windows characters are listed but cannot be accessed. Possible solutions are: Use the undocumented mount option for cifs # mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o nomapposix Configure Samba to remap (\"SFM\", Services for Mac) style characters to the correct native ones using fruit Manually remap forbidden characters using catia The latter approach (using catia or fruit) has the drawback of filtering files with unprintable characters.

Ensure that your samba user has access to the folder and all parent folders. You can test this by sudoing to the user and attempting to list the mount directory, and all of its parents. Mount error: Host is down This error might be seen when mounting shares of Synology NAS servers. Use the mount option to solve it. Software caused connection abort File managers that utilizes can show the error when writing a file to a share/server. This may be due to the server running SMB/CIFS version 1, which many routers use for USB drive sharing (e.g. Belkin routers). To write to these shares specify the CIFS version with the option . E.g.: This can also happen after updating Samba to version 4.11, which deactivates SMB1 as default, and accessing any Samba share. You can reenable it by adding Connection problem (due to authentification error) Be sure that you do not leave any space characters before your username in Samba client configuration file as follows: The correct format is: Windows 1709 or up does not discover the samba server in Network view With Windows 10 version 1511, support for SMBv1 and thus NetBIOS device discovery was disabled by default. Depending on the actual edition, later versions of Windows starting from version 1709 (\"Fall Creators Update\") do not allow the installation of the SMBv1 client anymore. This causes hosts running Samba not to be listed in the Explorer's \"Network (Neighborhood)\" views. While there is no connectivity problem and Samba will still run fine, users might want to have their Samba hosts to be listed by Windows automatically. implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon.

(This document does not describe how to host the shares yourself, only how to access shares that are hosted somewhere else. For hosting shares, use Samba .) Prerequisites We're assuming that: - Network connections have been configured properly. - Your local (Ubuntu) username is ubuntuusername . - Share username on Windows computer is msusername . - Share password on Windows computer is mspassword . - The Windows computer's name is servername this can be either an IP address or an assigned name). - The name of the share is sharename . - You want to mount the share in /media/windowsshare . CIFS installation On older systems: Mounting unprotected (guest) network folders First, let's create the mount directory. You will need a separate directory for each mount. Then edit your /etc/fstab file (with root privileges) to add this line: Where - guest indicates you don't need a password to access the share, - uid=1000 makes the Linux user specified by the id the owner of the mounted share, allowing them to rename files, - iocharset=utf8 allows access to files with names in non-English languages. This doesn't work with shares of devices like the Buffalo Tera Station, or Windows machines that export their shares using ISO8895-15. - If there is any space in the server path , you need to replace it by \\040, for example //servername/My\\040Documents` After you add the entry to /etc/fstab type: This will (re)mount all entries listed in /etc/fstab. Mount password protected network folders The quickest way to auto-mounting a password-protected share is to edit /etc/fstab (with root privileges), to add this line: This is not a good idea however: /etc/fstab is readable by everyone and so is your Windows password in it. The way around this is to use a credentials file. This is a file that contains just the username and password. Using a text editor, create a file for your remote servers logon credential: Enter your Windows username and password in the file: Save the file, exit the editor. Change the permissions of the file to prevent unwanted access to your credentials: Then edit your /etc/fstab file (with root privileges) to add this line (replacing the insecure line in the example above, if you added it): Save the file, exit the editor. Finally, test the fstab entry by issuing: If there are no errors, you should test how it works after a reboot. Your remote share should mount automatically. Special permissions If you need special permission (like chmod etc.), you'll need to add a uid (short for 'user id') or gid (for 'group id') parameter to the share's mount options. Mount password protected shares using libpam_mount (Ubuntu 9.04) In addition to the initial assumptions, we're assuming that - Your username and password are the same on the Ubuntu machine and on the network drive. Install libpam-mount: Edit /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml using your preferred text editor. First, we're moving the user specific config bits to a file which users can actually edit themselves: remove the commenting tags ( ) surrounding the section called . Save the file when done. With this in place, users can create their own \\~/.pam_mount.conf.xml. Add the following: Troubleshooting Login errors If you get the error \"mount error(13) permission denied\", then the server denied your access. Here are the first things to check: - Are you using a valid username and password? Does that account really have access to this folder? - Do you have whitespace in your credentials file? It should be , not . - Do you need a domain? For example, if you are told that your username is , then actually your username is and your domain is . The fstab entry should read: Or: - The security and version settings are interrelated. SMB1 is insecure and no longer supported by default. At first, try to not specify either security or version: do not specify or . If you still have authentication errors then you may need to specify either or or both. You can try the options listed at the [ mount.cifs man page ](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/en/man8/mount.cifs.8.html \"wikilink\") . The man page list leaves out the option for some reason, but you should try that one as well (`[`see `discussion ](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cifs-utils/+bug/1113395 \"wikilink\") ). Unprotected network folder won't automount I've had a situation where an unprotected network folder wouldn't automount during bootup, but after manually entering \"sudo mount -a\" was mounted correctly. I solved this by replacing the \"guest\" option by \"username=guest,password=\". If anyone has an explanation for this, please leave a comment. Mount during login instead of boot If for some reason/etc/rc0.d/S31umountnfs.sh (networking problems for example) the automatic mounting during boot doesn't work, you can add the \"noauto\" parameter to your smbfs fstab entry and then have the share mounted at login. In /etc/fstab: In /etc/rc.local: Slow shutdown due to a CIFS/Network Manager bug If you use Network Manager, and are getting really slow shutdowns, it's probably because NM shuts down before unmounting the network shares. That will cause CIFS to hang and wait for 60 seconds or so. Here's how to fix it:/etc/rc0.d/S31umountnfs.sh Ubuntu 12.04 already runs umountnfs.sh at reboot and shutdown by default (/etc/rc0.d/S31umountnfs.sh and /etc/rc6.d/S31umountnfs.sh) so this is no longer necessary. CIFS Options Deprecated 20 Feb 2008 TW Using dmask or fmask in the fstab file produces the following warnings: WARNING: CIFS mount option 'dmask' is deprecated. Use 'dir_mode' instead. WARNING: CIFS mount option 'fmask' is deprecated. Use 'file_mode' instead. Instead use this format: file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 .

I had to use the full path, i.e. /home/username/.smbcredentials (This is likely because the tilde \"\\~\" is only a shell short-hand alias for \"$HOME\"; it isn't something recognized system-wide by all programs, especially not in a system file table where the concept of \"HOME\" doesn't really exist. -Ian!)

You may also match any output by using the output name \"*\". Additionally, \"-\" can be used to match the focused output by name and \"--\" can be used to match the focused output by its identifier. Some outputs may have different names when disconnecting and reconnecting. To identify these, the name can be substituted for a string consisting of the make, model and serial which you can get from swaymsg -t get_outputs. Each value must be separated by one space. For example: output \"Some Company ABC123 0x00000000\" pos 1920 0 swaymsg -t get_outputs output mode|resolution|res [--custom] [@ [Hz]] Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each output, use swaymsg -t get_outputs. To set a custom mode not listed in the list of available modes, use --custom. You should probably only use this if you know what you're doing. Examples: output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz output position|pos Places the specified output at the specific position in the global coordinate space. The cursor may only be moved between immediately adjacent outputs. If scaling is active, it has to be considered when positioning. For example, if the scaling factor for the left output is 2, the relative position for the right output has to be divided by 2. The reference point is the top left corner so if you want the bottoms aligned this has to be considered as well. Example: output HDMI1 scale 2 output HDMI1 pos 0 1020 res 3200x1800 output eDP1 pos 1600 0 res 1920x1080 Note that the left x-pos of eDP1 is 1600 = 3200/2 and the bottom y-pos is 1020 + (1800 / 2) = 1920 = 0 + 1920 output scale Scales the specified output by the specified scale factor. An integer is recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next highest integer scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by setting an integer scale factor and adjusting the font size of your applications to taste. HiDPI isn't supported with Xwayland clients (windows will blur). output scale_filter linear|nearest|smart Indicates how to scale application buffers that are rendered at a scale lower than the output's configured scale, such as lo-dpi applications on hi-dpi screens. Linear is smoother and blurrier, nearest (also known as nearest neighbor) is sharper and blockier. Setting \"smart\" will apply nearest scaling when the output has an integer scale factor, otherwise linear. The default is \"smart\". output subpixel rgb|bgr|vrgb|vbgr|none Manually sets the subpixel hinting for the specified output. This value is usually auto-detected, but some displays may misreport their subpixel geometry. Using the correct subpixel hinting allows for sharper text. Incorrect values will result in blurrier text. When changing this via swaymsg, some applications may need to be restarted to use the new value. output background|bg [ ] Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the given scaling mode (one of \"stretch\", \"fill\", \"fit\", \"center\", \"tile\"). If the specified file cannot be accessed or if the image does fill the entire output, a fallback color may be provided to cover the rest of the output. fallback_color should be specified as #RRGGBB. Alpha is not supported. output background|bg solid_color Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. color should be specified as #RRGGBB. Alpha is not supported. output transform [clockwise|anticlockwise] Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of \"90\", \"180\", \"270\" for rotation; or \"flipped\", \"flipped-90\", \"flipped-180\", \"flipped-270\" to apply a rotation and flip, or \"normal\" to apply no transform. If a single output is chosen and a rotation direction is specified (clockwise or anticlockwise) then the transform is added or subtracted from the current transform. output disable|enable Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by default). output toggle Toggle the specified output. output dpms on|off Enables or disables the specified output via DPMS. To turn an output off (ie. blank the screen but keep workspaces as-is), one can set DPMS to off. output max_render_time off| When set to a positive number of milliseconds, enables delaying output rendering to reduce latency. The rendering is delayed in such a way as to leave the specified number of milliseconds before the next presentation for rendering. The output rendering normally takes place immediately after a presentation (vblank, buffer flip, etc.) and the frame callbacks are sent to surfaces immediately after the rendering to give surfaces the most time to draw their next frame. This results in slightly below 2 frames of latency between the surface rendering and committing new contents, and the contents being shown on screen, on average. When the output rendering is delayed, the frame callbacks are sent immediately after presentation, and the surfaces have a small timespan (1 / (refresh rate) - max_render_time) to render and commit new contents to be shown on the next presentation, resulting in below 1 frame of latency. To set this up for optimal latency: 1. Launch some full-screen application that renders continuously, like glxgears. 2. Start with max_render_time 1. Increment by 1 if you see frame drops. To achieve even lower latency, see the max_render_time surface property in sway(5). Note that this property has an effect only on backends which report the presentation timestamp and the predicted output refresh rate\u2014the DRM and the Wayland backends. Furthermore, under the Wayland backend the optimal max_render_time value may vary based on the parent compositor rendering timings. .config/sway/config.d/output.conf output DP-1 resolution 3440x1440@144Hz position 0,0 adaptive_sync off output DP-4 resolution 2560x1440@59.951Hz transform 270 position 3440,0 .config/sway/definitions.d/custom.conf set $idle_timeout 240 set $locking_timeout 1200 set $screen_timeout 1200 set $swayidle swayidle -w \\ timeout $idle_timeout 'light -G > /tmp/brightness && light -S 10' resume 'light -S $([ -f /tmp/brightness ] && cat /tmp/brightness || echo 100%)' \\ timeout $locking_timeout 'exec $locking' \\ timeout $screen_timeout 'swaymsg \"output * dpms off\"' \\ resume 'swaymsg \"output * dpms on\"' \\ before-sleep 'playerctl pause' \\ before-sleep 'exec $locking' .config/waybar/config.jsonc // ============================================================================= // // Waybar configuration // // Configuration reference: https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Configuration // // ============================================================================= { \"include\": [ \"/usr/share/sway/templates/waybar/config.jsonc\" ], // ------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Global configuration // ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"layer\": \"top\", // If height property would be not present, it'd be calculated dynamically \"height\": 30, \"position\": \"top\", \"modules-left\": [\"custom/menu\", \"sway/workspaces\", \"custom/scratchpad\"], \"modules-center\": [\"custom/wf-recorder\", \"sway/mode\", \"custom/weather\"], \"modules-right\": [ // informational \"sway/language\", \"custom/github\", \"custom/clipboard\", \"custom/zeit\", \"cpu\", \"memory\", \"battery\", \"temperature\", // connecting \"network\", \"bluetooth\", // media \"custom/playerctl\", \"idle_inhibitor\", \"custom/dnd\", \"pulseaudio\", \"backlight\", // system \"custom/adaptive-light\", \"custom/sunset\", \"custom/pacman\", \"tray\", \"clock\" ], // ------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Modules // ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"battery\": { \"interval\": 30, \"states\": { \"warning\": 30, \"critical\": 15 }, \"format-charging\": \"\uf583 {capacity}%\", \"format\": \"{icon} {capacity}%\", \"format-icons\": [\"\uf582\", \"\uf579\", \"\uf57a\", \"\uf57d\", \"\uf57f\", \"\uf578\"], \"tooltip\": true }, \"clock\": { \"interval\": 60, \"format\": \"{:%e %b %Y %H:%M}\", \"tooltip\": true, \"tooltip-format\": \"<big>{:%B %Y}</big>\\n<tt>{calendar}</tt>\", \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$calendar\" }, \"cpu\": { \"interval\": 5, \"format\": \"\ufb19 {usage}%\", \"states\": { \"warning\": 70, \"critical\": 90 }, \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$term_float htop\" }, \"memory\": { \"interval\": 5, \"format\": \"\uf85a {}%\", \"states\": { \"warning\": 70, \"critical\": 90 }, \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$term_float htop\" }, \"network\": { \"interval\": 5, \"format-wifi\": \"\uf1eb \", \"format-ethernet\": \"\uf6ff\", \"format-disconnected\": \"\ufaa9\", \"tooltip-format\": \"{ifname} ({essid}): {ipaddr}\", \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$term_float nmtui\" }, \"sway/mode\": { \"format\": \"<span style=\\\"italic\\\">{}</span>\", \"tooltip\": false }, \"idle_inhibitor\": { \"format\": \"{icon}\", \"format-icons\": { \"activated\": \"\uf9b2\", \"deactivated\": \"\uf9b1\" }, \"tooltip\": true, \"tooltip-format-activated\": \"power-saving disabled\", \"tooltip-format-deactivated\": \"power-saving enabled\" }, \"backlight\": { \"format\": \"{icon} {percent}%\", \"format-icons\": [\"\uf5dd\", \"\uf5de\", \"\uf5df\"], \"on-scroll-up\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$brightness_up\", \"on-scroll-down\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$brightness_down\" }, \"pulseaudio\": { \"scroll-step\": 5, \"format\": \"{icon} {volume}%{format_source}\", \"format-muted\": \"\ufa80 {format_source}\", \"format-source\": \"\", \"format-source-muted\": \" \uf86c\", \"format-icons\": { \"headphone\": \"\uf7ca\", \"headset\": \"\uf7cd\", \"default\": [\"\ufa7e\", \"\ufa7f\", \"\ufa7d\"] }, \"tooltip-format\": \"{icon}\u200a{volume}% {format_source}\", \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$pulseaudio\", \"on-click-middle\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$volume_mute\", \"on-scroll-up\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$volume_up\", \"on-scroll-down\": \"swaymsg exec \\\\$volume_down\" }, \"temperature\": { \"critical-threshold\": 90, \"interval\": 5, \"format\": \"{icon} {temperatureC}\u00b0\", \"format-icons\": [\"\uf2cb\", \"\uf2c9\", \"\uf2c8\"], \"tooltip\": false, \"on-click\": \"swaymsg exec \\\"\\\\$term_float watch sensors\\\"\" }, \"tray\": { \"icon-size\": 21, \"spacing\": 5 }, \"custom/pacman\": { \"format\": \"\uf53b {}\", \"interval\": 3600, \"exec-if\": \"[ $(pamac checkupdates -q | wc -l) -gt 0 ]\", \"exec\": \"pamac checkupdates -q | wc -l\", \"on-click\": \"pamac-manager --updates;

The rendering is delayed in such a way as to leave the specified number of milliseconds before the next presentation for rendering. The output rendering normally takes place immediately after a presentation (vblank, buffer flip, etc.) and the frame callbacks are sent to surfaces immediately after the rendering to give surfaces the most time to draw their next frame. This results in slightly below 2 frames of latency between the surface rendering and committing new contents, and the contents being shown on screen, on average. When the output rendering is delayed, the frame callbacks are sent immediately after presentation, and the surfaces have a small timespan (1 / (refresh rate) - max_render_time) to render and commit new contents to be shown on the next presentation, resulting in below 1 frame of latency. To set this up for optimal latency: 1. Launch some full-screen application that renders continuously, like glxgears. 2. Start with max_render_time 1. Increment by 1 if you see frame drops. To achieve even lower latency, see the max_render_time surface property in sway(5). Note that this property has an effect only on backends which report the presentation timestamp and the predicted output refresh rate\u2014the DRM and the Wayland backends.
